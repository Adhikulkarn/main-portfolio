                    <br><br>My journey with the AMC Math Club has been an incredible learning experience,
                    starting from my initial role in the <b>"Registration and Stage Management" department</b>. I was
                    later selected for the elite
                    <b>"Optimal Operations team",</b>
                    where I took on the responsibility of a <b>"Technical Team Lead"</b>, contributing to project
                    development in the <b>"Technical Department"</b>.
                    From there, I transitioned into the <b>"Tech Department"</b>, where I’ve served as a
                    <b>"captain"</b> to this day.
                    Throughout this journey, I have gained invaluable knowledge—not just in technical skills but also in
                    leadership, teamwork,
                    and problem-solving. Working alongside passionate individuals, I’ve learned how to optimize
                    operations, develop innovative solutions,
                    and lead a team effectively, all of which have shaped my experience in the AMC Math Club.

                    I had the incredible opportunity to participate in <b>"Hackazion V.1"</b>, a national-level
                    hackathon held at <b>"AMC Engineering College"</b>,
                    where our team, <b>"Byte Brigade"</b>, secured 2nd place. Our project was under the domain of
                    <b>"Blockchain and Web3"</b>,
                    where we developed an <b>"Online Voting System using Blockchain"</b>. My primary contribution was
                    "handling the database while integrating Ethereum
                    to ensure secure and transparent voting processes". This hackathon was an eye-opening experience,
                    allowing me to work on a real-world problem while collaborating with a highly skilled team.
                    The event not only strengthened my technical skills, enhanced my teamwork,
                    problem-solving abilities, and adaptability under pressure, making it an unforgettable experience.
